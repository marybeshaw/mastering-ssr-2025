# Mastering Server-Side Development for React Developers - Demo App

This is a demo application for Mary Shaw's conference presentation, "Mastering Server-Side Development for React Developers". The presentation will be given at:

- **UtahJS Conf 2025** - September 12, 2025
- **International JavaScript Conference** - September 30, 2025

This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project is a **simple blog post application** that demonstrates the differences between server-side and client-side components in React 19, as well as different patterns for handling user interactions. The app was deliberately kept simple to showcase specific React Server Component behaviors and console.log patterns.

 ðŸŽ¯ **New!** This repository includes an **[Interactive Code Tour](#interactive-code-tour)** that provides step-by-step guided explanations of all the concepts demonstrated in the presentation. Perfect for following along during the talk or reviewing the material afterward!

 ðŸš€ **Pro Tip:** For the best experience, **[run the app locally](#getting-started)** while taking the code tour! You'll be able to see the console.log behavior, test the interactive features, and observe the differences between server and client components in real-time.

## App Overview

This demo app is a **simple blog post application** featuring:

- **Blog Post Display** - Shows blog post content using server-side rendering
- **Like Button** - Increment likes on posts (demonstrates optimistic UI patterns)  
- **Comment System** - Add and display comments (demonstrates Server Actions)

The application was intentionally kept simple to focus on demonstrating specific server-side rendering concepts and console.log behaviors in different component types.

## Visual Component Indicators

This app includes special visual indicators to help distinguish between different component types:

- **Hybrid Components** (`"use client"` renders on both server & client): Light blue background with an "H" icon in the upper-right corner
- **Server Components** (default React 19 components): Light green background with an "S" icon in the upper-right corner

## Demo Features

### BlogPost Component
The main `BlogPost` component displays blog post data and is located at `src/components/BlogPost.jsx`. It currently uses static data from `data/posts.json`. This server component renders the post title, excerpt, and contains the interactive features below.

### Interactive Features

This app demonstrates two different patterns for handling user interactions:

#### 1. LikesButton - API Call Pattern
- **File**: `src/components/LikesButton.js`
- **Type**: Client component
- **Interaction**: Uses traditional API calls to a REST endpoint
- **API Route**: `src/app/api/likes/[postId]/route.js`
- **Data Storage**: `data/likes.json`
- **Behavior**: Fetches current likes on mount, sends POST request to increment likes

#### 2. CommentForm with CommentList - Server Action Pattern  
- **Form Component**: `src/components/CommentForm.jsx` (client component)
- **List Component**: `src/components/CommentList.jsx` (server component)
- **Type**: Client component (form) + Server component (list)
- **Interaction**: Uses React Server Actions for form submission
- **Server Action**: `src/actions/commentActions.js`
- **Data Library**: `src/lib/comments.js`
- **Data Storage**: `data/comments.json`
- **Behavior**: Uses React Server Actions for form submission, automatically revalidates page data

## Interactive Code Tour

This repository includes an interactive CodeTour that guides you through the key concepts demonstrated in the presentation. The tour provides step-by-step explanations of server components, client components, and hybrid patterns.

### Installing the CodeTour Extension

1. **In VS Code**: Open the Extensions panel (`Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux)
2. **Search for**: "CodeTour" by vsls-contrib
3. **Install** the extension
4. **Reload** VS Code if prompted

### Running the Tour

1. **Open the Command Palette**: `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
2. **Type**: "CodeTour: Start Tour"
3. **Select**: "SSR Components Deep Dive" from the list
4. **Follow along**: Use the navigation controls to step through each explanation

The tour covers:
- **Server Components** (CommentList) - Pure server-side rendering
- **Client Components** (LikesButton) - Hybrid rendering with optimistic UI
- **Server Actions** (CommentForm) - Direct server-client integration
- **Console.log behavior** - Where logs appear in different component types
- **Modern React patterns** - useOptimistic, useActionState, and revalidatePath

### Tour Benefits

- **Self-paced learning** - Go through the concepts at your own speed
- **Code context** - See explanations directly alongside the relevant code
- **Presentation companion** - Perfect for following along during the talk
- **Reference material** - Come back to review concepts anytime

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Key Learning Points

- **Server vs Client Components**: Visual indicators make it easy to see which components run where
- **API Calls vs Server Actions**: Compare the two different patterns for handling user interactions
- **Data Flow**: Observe how data flows differently between client API calls and server actions
- **Performance**: Notice the different loading behaviors and page updates
